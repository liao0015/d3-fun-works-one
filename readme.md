# shadow project on D3

introduction: Three small fun projects were built to study D3 & SVG.  Many of the functions were written using vanilla JS instead of D3's APIs.  A great way to learn the stuff underneath.  

- selection,enter&exit
- zoom using scale, translate & viewbox
- smooth path using svg's native cubic curve features

installation & environment:

```shell
yarn add -D webpack webpack-cli style-loader css-loader html-webpack-plugin webpack-dev-server clean-webpack-plugin
```

```shell
yarn add d3
```

Run:

```shell
yarn start
yarn build
```
